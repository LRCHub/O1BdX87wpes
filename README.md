[00:07.24] (Ay-ay-ay-ya)
[00:13.74] 
[00:09.13] Take a dive from the sky into the deepest hell
[00:11.42] If you survive down below where the darkness dwells
[00:13.66] So deep that you can't even hear the bells
[00:16.07] All along was our nest, couldn't even tell
[00:37.07] 
[00:18.36] 蹴る大気 駆け抜ける lightning
[00:20.42] 吼える影 旋風 frightening
[00:22.87] 井の中でイキるニンゲンに
[00:25.22] Actions all have consequences
[00:39.72] 
[00:27.90] Oh, you humans so naive and desperate (uh-uh)
[00:32.44] Enough to think that luck and fate have favorites (uh-uh)
[00:36.93] 禁忌を感じたいのなら触れ (uh-uh)
[00:40.98] 抗ってその運命
[00:43.49] Oh, oh, oh, oh
[00:50.49] 
[00:45.40] If you reach for it, I'll burn ya
[00:47.51] With a dragon's heart of fire
[00:49.92] 跪け従いな
[00:52.32] Ay-ay-ay-ya
[00:57.82] 
[00:54.40] Flying straight into desire
[00:56.89] Ever, oh, so higher
[00:58.97] 空 全て支配下
[01:01.57] Ay-ay-ay-ya
[01:07.07]
